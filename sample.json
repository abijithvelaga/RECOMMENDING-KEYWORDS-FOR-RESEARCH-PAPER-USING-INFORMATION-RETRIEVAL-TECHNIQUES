{"abstract":"Paper presents a survey of methods and approaches for keyword extraction task. In addition to the systematization of methods, the paper gathers a comprehensive review of existing research. Related work on keyword extraction is elaborated for supervised and unsupervised methods, with special emphasis on graphbased methods as well as Croatian keyword extraction. Selectivity-based keyword extraction method is proposed as a new unsupervised graph-based keyword extraction method which extracts nodes from a complex network as keyword candidates. The paper provides guidelines for future research and development of new graph-based approaches for keyword extraction."}
